# Ben Massey photography portfolio

This is my personal photography portfolio, built with ReactJS. There isn't an awful lot to it. I originally built it with ReactJS to practise with the library, you could argue that it didn't need building with React at all.

There are a series of pages, including a Portfolio page and a Contact form which uses PHPMail to send me an email.

For administration purposes: To add a new photo easily, a process has been devised. The following files/directories are listed in order of which they should be updated/dealt with.

- *images* directory is where images are stored
- *images.json* stores the image references for the database Python script to read from
- *imageList.js* stores the front-end image references for ReactJS to read from
- *database_init.py* initialises the database with data in the images.json file
