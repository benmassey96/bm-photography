# Ben Massey photography portfolio

This is my personal photography portfolio, built with ReactJS. There isn't an awful lot to it. I originally built it with ReactJS to practise with the library, you could argue that it didn't need building with React at all.

There are a series of pages, including a Portfolio page and a Contact form which uses PHPMail to send me an email.
